Nurtch supports execution of |all major programming languages| thanks to Jupyter. This is achieved by installing lanaguage kernel for that particular language. Nurtch comes with Python kernel installed out of the box. If you want to install kernel for any other programming language |write to us| and we'll help you with the build.



Editing Notebook
------------------
Any Notebook is opened in the viewing mode by default. You can view content, execute code cells, and see output. Editing is disabled to avoid committing changes unintentionally. Click on the `EDIT` button if you wish to make changes to the Notebook.

Once editing is enabled you can change the content as you desire. Once editing is done you can `Preview` the Notebook, if you are satisfied with modifications then `Publish` the changes to S3. At any time you can `Discard` your changes to go back to original version.
